# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a reusable piece of code that performs an action.
  It's used when we want to do something multiple times and we don't want to
  have repetitive code to do it. Functions should also follow the encapsulation
  pillar of OOP, where the logic is wrapped to perform a single action and does
  not count on external information.

2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: Argument and parameter seems to be used interchangeably with
  functions. Parameters are used when defining the function, it can take zero
  or more parameters. When calling a function, arguments are used to match the
  number of parameters that the function takes.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the designated space in storage that an array
  or string uses to put data. The index gives the location where the data
  is held and is zero-based, meaning that 0th index is the start of the
  array and the last index is the array's length-1. The value is the
  actual data that is held inside that space and can be any data type,
  whereas the index is a number.

4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a predefined function provided by the
  programming language that can be used on data types such as arrays and
  strings. Built-in methods make it easier for the developer to
  work on common tasks such as changing capitalization on strings with
  .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase(), and sorting arrays with .sort().

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming involves a driver, the person who
  has control of the keyboard and writes the code, and the navigator,
  the one who does the thinking and guides the driver on what to write.
  Proper techniques include having a balance in the time spent in each
  role and holding oneself accountable. Each role teaches different
  things, where the driver works on their problem solving abilities
  and communicates that, and the navigator must also be able to
  understand or communicate to the driver to explain their logic.
