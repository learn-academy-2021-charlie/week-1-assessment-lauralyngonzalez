# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a reusable piece of code that performs an action.
  It's used when we want to do something multiple times and we don't want to
  have repetitive code to do it. Functions should also follow the encapsulation pillar of OOP, where the logic is wrapped to perform a single action and does not count on external information.

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable blocks of code that can take
  input and have an output. They are executed when invoked with optional
  arguments passed in and the function can use them through its declared
  parameters. 



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: Parameters are used when defining the function and it can take zero or more parameters. When calling the function, arguments are passed in and must match the number of parameters that the function takes.

  Researched answer: Parameters are the placeholders that are defined in the
  function expression to be used in code logic. Arguments are the values
  passed in when the function is invoked.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the designated space in storage that an array
  or string uses to put data. The index gives the location where the data
  is held and is zero-based, meaning that 0th index is the start of the
  array and the last index is the array's length-1. The value is the
  actual data that is held inside that space and can be any data type,
  whereas the index is a number.

  Researched answer: An index is the address location for each value in the
  array. They are whole numbers that go up sequentially for each address and
  start from 0. The element at the address is the value and has a data type.
  The index is used to retrieve the value by referencing the variable name
  of the array.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a predefined function provided by the
  programming language that can be used on data types such as arrays and
  strings. Built-in methods make it easier for the developer to
  work on common tasks such as changing capitalization on strings with
  .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase(), and sorting arrays with .sort().

  Researched answer: Built-in methods are functions added by the language
  to perform common tasks. They might require an argument or more to be
  used properly. For arrays, built-in methods can further be divided into
  mutator and accessor methods. Mutator methods manipulate the data while
  accessor methods access the data.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming involves a driver, the person who
  has control of the keyboard and writes the code, and the navigator,
  the one who does the thinking and guides the driver on what to write.
  Proper techniques include having a balance in the time spent in each
  role and holding oneself accountable. Each role teaches different
  things, where the driver works on their problem solving abilities
  and communicates that, and the navigator must also be able to
  understand or communicate to the driver to explain their logic.

  Researched answer: The driver is the one on the keyboard and follows
  what the navigator says to code. Both roles require communication and
  should be switched every 10-20 minutes with some breaks.
  Pair programming helps by dividing cognitive tasks, holding each other
  accountable, and makes it easier to focus on coding instead of being
  distracted. This way, better code is produced because both people are
  working at solving the problem.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I liked the kahoot game that was like a preliminary
  assessment on Javascript. I got to test out my knowledge and find
  out what I need to brush up on. The music is a bit much but that's
  part of the fun.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: The process of doing the same action a certain number of times
or when a condition is met. Iterations are used in loops and the code is
executed while the conditional expression is true. 

2. Higher Order Functions: Functions that take another function as input
or returns another function as output. Higher order functions must have
at least one argument. .map() and .filter() are higher order functions
that must take a value and optionally and index and array.

3. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework so that we can see if our
code's input matches our expected output. Test driven development helps
produce higher quality code.

4. Classes: Classes are blueprints for objects, which consist of data and
behavior. They are reusable pieces of code where you can keep creating
more objects of that type.

5. React: React is a Javascript library that uses components to build
applications. Components are like functions and components are brought
together to build a complex application.
